This file talks about what software AmogOS uses

# RPI
The RPI version of AmogOS is made with a RPI OS lite base and developed bare metal. It uses Openbox for the WM and LXDE for the DE. From there, the Papyrus theme was used for the OS icons. A lot of apps are preinstalled, as detailed in the features section on README. The OS is read from SD Card to a .img with GNOME Disks, and then finally shrunk with pishrink.
