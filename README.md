## General Info

This OS is inspired of the parody OS "AmogOS", based of Raspberry PI, this OS is just a funny piece of meme, we made it for fun, don't take it seriously,
we do not recommend you to use it as a main OS, it contains bugs and it's not fully finished.
But, you can still use it as a second OS! Have fun using it!
